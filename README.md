When creating this website I envisioned a simplifed way to create a structured weekly scheduale.

To use the website you need to make an account, my implementation of the account system used bcrypt to encrypt the passwords. 
The website has the functionality to create an event for a singular day or make a schedule that repeats weekly. These events/scheduales can be edited or deleted at anytime.
